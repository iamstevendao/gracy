Yet another minimal Jekyll theme.  
Based on [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme, inspired by [EvanHahn](http://evanhahn.com/)'s blog, and used [VSCode theme](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pygments-css/blob/master/vscode.css) for code snippets.

### Checkout [my blog](https://iamstevendao.github.io/blog/) as a sample.

## Installation
Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem "gracy"
```
And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:
```yaml
theme: gracy
```
And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```
Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install gracy
```

## Usage
- Instructions about adding posts and diary are pretty much explained inside.
- You can customize files inside `includes` folder for **header**, **footer**, and **icon**.
- `_config.yml` includes all comments about modification.
